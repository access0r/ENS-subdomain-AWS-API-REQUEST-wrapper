This code initializes the ENS resolver contract with the current Accessor Token ID,
defines a custom signer that uses the current Accessor Token ID to sign AWS credentials requests, 
and wraps AWS API requests as a signer with an ENS subdomain. It then uses AWS API with the wrapped 
signer to list S3 buckets.

Note that this code uses the @aws-amplify/core library for signing AWS requests with a custom signer.
You would need to install this library with npm install @aws-amplify/core. 

If you're not using @aws-amplify/core, 
you would need to sign AWS requests manually with the aws4 library or similar.
